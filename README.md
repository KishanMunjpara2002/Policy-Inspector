# Policy Inspector

Policy Inspector is a Streamlit application for inspecting policies and generating responses based on user queries. It utilizes a language model and a vector indexing system to provide relevant responses from a dataset.

## Overview

This application is designed to streamline the process of inspecting policies by allowing users to input queries related to the policy and receive relevant responses. It uses the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) library for language model fine-tuning and [LLAMA Index](https://github.com/LLNL/LLAMA) for indexing and querying responses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KishanMunjpara2002/Policy-Inspector.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. Upon running the application, upload an Excel dataset containing policy-related queries and responses.

2. Once the dataset is uploaded, the application will display the loaded dataset.

3. You can input your query in the provided text box.

4. The application will provide a response based on the query from the uploaded dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- pandas
- transformers
- torch
- llama-index
- langchain

## Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to set up the required configurations in the `app.py` file. 

- `name`: The name of the Hugging Face model.
- `auth_token`: Authentication token for accessing the model.
- `quantization_config`: Configuration for quantization.
- `system_prompt`: System prompt for the language model.
- `query_wrapper_prompt`: Query wrapper prompt for the language model.
- `context_window`: Context window size for the language model.
- `max_new_tokens`: Maximum number of new tokens for the language model.
- `rope_scaling`: Rope scaling configuration for the language model.
- `chunk_size`: Chunk size for the service context.
- `model_name`: Name of the Hugging Face model for embeddings.
